                      <h2><em><strong>Everything, Everything</strong></em> by David Yoon</h2>

                      <p class="mt-3 mb-4">My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.
                      <br><br>But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.</p>

                    <h3>I really enjoyed this, especially the last 1/3 of the book! It had a unique premise, a great main character, a nice romance, and a great message. I recommend to all of you looking for a good quick read, whether you are usually a fan of YA romance or not!</h3>
